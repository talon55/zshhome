Automagic Zsh Setup
============================

A prebuilt ZSH environment using sane defaults and some extra aliases to make
the working easier. Note that my idea of "sane" may be different from yours.

Installation
------------

This config will work with the current stock version of zsh packaged with
OS X 10.9.3 (zsh version 5.0.2) but should work with zsh installed using
homebrew. Prezto requires at least version 4.3.11.

  1. git clone git@github.com:talon55/zshhome.git ~/.zsh

  2. Run the included setup script (~/.zsh/setup.sh)

  3. Set your default shell to zsh using the instructions at
     http://superuser.com/questions/379725/how-do-i-change-a-users-default-shell-in-osx

Notes
-----

  * The ~/.zsh/env file is not currently in use, but should work fine if sourced.

  * Prezto's github page can be found at https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.
    You can reference it for further customizations.

  * This environment was designed to work fully independent from any existing
    bash environment, so switching back should be as painless as setting your
    default shell back to bash.
